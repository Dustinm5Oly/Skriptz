## Description

* This application is to allow the user to keep track of all monthly subscriptions and billing dates.
* Our motivation to create this project is to help users manage spending on their monthly subscriptions while also keep track of their total cost for each month.
* Our group designed this webpage to help understand how to work together to create an application that uses a database to relay information to users while keeping track for future review.
* The webpage allows the user to store their monthly subscriptions, review other options, delete subscriptions to bring down their monthly billing and keep track of when the bills are due.
